Doing so they can seamlessly access their favourite sites and collected bookmarks, greatly improving productivity. In Cloud Dial each bookmark will be identifiable by an image. This will make it visually appealing and extremely practical to use in this way, especially on mobile devices."

This rich variety of information will ensure efficient browsing, and effective bookmark retrieval."
				+ "It is hoped this system will be used by all web browser users, but more specifically, by those who bookmark regularly. An ideal user bookmarks on several different devices, bookmarking pages of various topics. For people who bookmark a lot, and need to retrieve specific bookmarks on many devices, Cloud Dial is the perfect solution.",
